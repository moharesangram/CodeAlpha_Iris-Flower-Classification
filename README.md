# Iris Flower Classification | CoreAlpha Data Science Internship

## Project Overview

This project is part of the **CoreAlpha Data Science Internship**.
The task focuses on building a machine learning model to classify iris flowers
into different species based on their physical measurements.

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning and is widely used
for understanding and practicing classification algorithms.

## Problem Statement

The Iris flower has three species:

* Iris Setosa
* Iris Versicolor
* Iris Virginica

Each species differs based on the following measurements:

* Sepal Length
* Sepal Width
* Petal Length
* Petal Width

The objective is to train a machine learning model that can correctly classify
the species of an iris flower based on these measurements.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of numerical measurements of iris flowers along with
their corresponding species labels.

The dataset is loaded using the **Scikit-learn** library or provided as a CSV file.
Each row represents a single flower sample.

## Tools & Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* Jupyter Notebook

## Methodology

* Imported required Python libraries
* Loaded and explored the dataset
* Checked for missing and duplicate values
* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Visualized relationships between features
* Split the dataset into training and testing sets
* Trained a classification model
* Evaluated model performance using accuracy and classification metrics

## Results

The trained machine learning model successfully classified iris flower species
based on the given measurements with good accuracy.

## Conclusion

This project provided hands-on experience with fundamental machine learning
concepts, classification algorithms, and real-world data handling using Python.
It also strengthened understanding of the end-to-end data science workflow as
part of the **CoreAlpha Data Science Internship**.
